# Express Cinema

## Introduction

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/36983687-49a3d64e-2093-11e8-8b86-b11813f0cdba.png)

We will create a cinema web page, where we will display the showtimes for some movies!

## Requirements

- Fork this repo
- Clone this repo


## Submission

Upon completion, run the following commands:
```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "done"
$ git push origin master
```

- Create Pull Request so your TAs can check up your work.



## Instructions

### Iteration 0 | Initialize the project

After forking and cloning the project, you will have to add a `starter_code/.env` file:

```
PORT=3000
```

And you have to install all the dependencies:


```sh
$ cd starter_code
$ npm install
```

Now you are ready to start ðŸš€


### Iteration 1 | Seed the database

First, we need to seed our database. Below you will find an array of objects with info for 8 movies. You should create two files:
- `models/Movie.js` for the Movie model
- `bin/seeds.js` file inside the `bin` folder and write the code necessary to seed the database.



```javascript
// To insert in "bin/seeds.js"

const movies = [

```

### Iteration 2 | The Home Page

We need our home page. Simple and beautiful, on the `index.hbs` create the following home page:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/36986664-acd6af14-209a-11e8-816d-b62417239c53.png)

The `button` should be a link redirecting to the `/movies` route.

### Iteration 3 | List the Movies

On the `/movies` route, we need to list all the movies we have in our database. You should create a `movies.hbs` file, and display a list of all the movies.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23629340/36986832-240fe492-209b-11e8-94de-a7334af41076.png)

### Iteration 4 | Display Movie Info

Finally, you have to create a view to display all the info about each movie. You need a `movie/:id` route, where the user can check all the info about each movie, after clicking on the `See More` button of the `/movies` view.

Happy Coding! :heart:
