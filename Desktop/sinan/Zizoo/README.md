It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Task

Create a simple response component for the call list card in this repository.
Request search results from the GraphQL API, which is newer than 2010, for all boats from 10 to 20m in length.
Process the results using the API response and reaction component.

## Additional 
Many features need to be completed or corrected over time.
In fact, I'm not experienced with GraphQl from time to time because I didn't implement unit test and responsive design because I'm actually writing a Graphql query for the first time. I haven't exactly tested the code.
